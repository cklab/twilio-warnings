# twilio-warnings
Creating a framework target with Twilio dependencies causes warnings.

Steps
====
 1. Clone the repo.
 2. Run ./setup.sh to install the Twilio libraries.

In place of running ./setup.sh, you can download the frameworks TwilioCommon and TwilioConversationsClient from [Twilio's SDK page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/sdks#ios-sdk) and place the `.framework` folders in a `libs` directory in the directory.
